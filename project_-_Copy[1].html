<h2 style="color:azure"><mark>What Is a Satellite?</mark></h2>
<p style="color:azure" align="left">
A satellite is a moon, planet or machine that orbits a planet or star. For example, Earth is a satellite because it orbits the sun.</br>
 Likewise, the moon is a satellite because it orbits Earth. Usually, the word "satellite" refers to a machine that is launched into space </br>
 and moves around Earth or another body in space.</br>

Earth and the moon are examples of natural satellites. Thousands of artificial, or man-made, satellites orbit Earth. Some take pictures of</br>
 the planet that help meteorologists predict weather and track hurricanes. Some take pictures of other planets, the sun, black holes,</br>
 dark matter or faraway galaxies. These pictures help scientists better understand the solar system and universe.</br>

Still other satellites are used mainly for communications, such as beaming TV signals and phone calls around the world.</br>
 A group of more than 20 satellites make up the Global Positioning System, or GPS. If you have a GPS receiver, these satellites can help figure out your location.

<h2 style="color:azure"><mark>What Are The Parts Of a Satellite?</mark></h2>
<p style="color:azure">
Satellites come in many shapes and sizes. But most have at least two parts in common - an antenna and a power source.</br>
 The antenna sends and receives information, often to and from Earth. The power source can be a solar panel or battery.</br>
 Solar panels make power by turning sunlight into electricity.</br>

Many NASA satellites carry cameras and scientific sensors. Sometimes these instruments point toward Earth to gather</br> 
information about its land, air and water. Other times they face toward space to collect data from the solar system and universe.

<h2 style="color:azure"><mark>How Do Satellites Orbit Earth?</mark></h2>
<p style="color:azure">
Most satellites are launched into space on rockets. A satellite orbits Earth when its speed is balanced by the pull of Earth's gravity.</br>
 Without this balance, the satellite would fly in a straight line off into space or fall back to Earth. Satellites orbit Earth at different</br>
 heights, different speeds and along different paths. The two most common types of orbit are "geostationary" (jee-oh-STAY-shun-air-ee) and "polar."</br>

A geostationary satellite travels from west to east over the equator. It moves in the same direction and at the same rate Earth is spinning.</br>
 From Earth, a geostationary satellite looks like it is standing still since it is always above the same location.</br>

Polar-orbiting satellites travel in a north-south direction from pole to pole. As Earth spins underneath, these satellites can scan the entire globe, one strip at a time.
</p>
<h2 style="color:azure"><mark>Why Don't Satellites crash into Each Other?</mark></h2>
<p style="color:azure">
Actually, they can. NASA and other U.S. and international organizations keep track of satellites in space.</br>
 Collisions are rare because when a satellite is launched, it is placed into an orbit designed to avoid other satellites.</br>
 But orbits can change over time. And the chances of a crash increase as more and more satellites are launched into space.</br>

In February 2009, two communications satellites - one American and one Russian - collided in space. This, however,</br>
 is believed to be the first time two man-made satellites have collided accidentally.

<h2 style="color:azure"><mark>What Was the First Satellite in Space?</mark></h2>
<p style="color:azure">
Sputnik 1 was the first satellite in space. The Soviet Union launched it in 1957.
